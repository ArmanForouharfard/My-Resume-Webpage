                        History:<br/>  
                        The ideas of this University has built by Founder of the Forouhar-Industries: Arman.Forouharfard,
                        he mantion this:<br/>
                        When i finished my high school, i've had a research on the Universites on Tehran.Iran!<br/>
                            At the first time i've been thinking to Sign into a University called: Alemi karboudi !<br/>
                            <br/>
                            But...i wasn't sure about the Report card that they have!...in fact i didn't know About that is it officall outside the my country; 
                            i also had some help with some groups who helped students like me in these situations, before i choose to make it officall!
                            the group told that Alemi karboudi is a good University but nobody outside the country know this University at All !;
                                they offered me Azad University, i never thought that they had any technicall majors in their list!!; <br/>
                                <br/>
                                i signed up there but i also checked the Alemi karboudi's classes and lessons, they were really busy,their plans were high, i wished they could do somethings for it,
                                but well,...
                                so i choosed to make my own technicall University to show people that everyone can make impossible to possible and everyone can create their own dreams if they have the right masters, tools and materials.
